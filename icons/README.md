# Icon Creation Instructions

To complete the extension, you'll need to create three icon files in the following sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Design Specifications

Create a simple clock/timer icon with these characteristics:
- Primary color: #e74c3c (the red color used in the extension)
- Secondary color: white or light gray for contrast
- Background shape: circle
- Foreground: clock/timer symbol

## Tools for Creating Icons

You can create these icons using one of these methods:

### Option 1: Use an Online Icon Generator
1. Visit [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)
2. Create a simple clock/timer icon using the color #e74c3c
3. Download in the required sizes
4. Rename to match the filenames needed

### Option 2: Use a Free SVG Editor
1. Use a tool like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (free) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (free tier)
2. Create a circular background with the color #e74c3c
3. Add a simple white clock symbol
4. Export in the three required sizes

### Option 3: Download a Pre-made Icon
1. Download a free timer/productivity icon from a site like [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
2. Ensure you have the right to use the icon
3. Resize to the required dimensions
4. Modify colors if necessary to match our theme

## Placeholder Instructions

Until you create the actual icons, the extension will still work but will use Chrome's default icon. When you're ready to add the icons, simply place the three PNG files in this directory with the exact names specified above.
